# An Effective Marine Predators Algorithm for Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem

This repository provides an optimized solution for the Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) using the Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA), implemented within the Mealpy optimization framework and tested on the Brandimarte benchmark dataset with 10 instances. By leveraging MPA, this approach aims to minimize makespan effectively, enhancing scheduling efficiency.

In addition to MPA, this code compares scheduling performance against other well-known metaheuristic algorithms, including Neighborhood Random Optimization (NRO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Hill Climbing (HC), and Whale Optimization Heuristic (WHO). The flexible design allows researchers and developers to test, modify, and further optimize FJSP solutions with Mealpy's suite of tools.

## Features
- *Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA)* implementation for FJSP
- *Comparative Analysis*: Includes comparisons with NRO, PSO, HC, and WHO
- *Brandimarte Benchmark Dataset*: Evaluation across 10 standardized FJSP instances
- *Customizable Parameters*: Experiment with different configurations for extensive testing
- *Ease of Use*: Designed for flexible adaptation and further research

## Getting Started
The repository contains example scripts and instructions for running tests across the included algorithms and benchmark instances, making it ideal for optimization research in scheduling and productionÂ environments.
